# Car Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a simple project for predicting car prices using a Linear Regression model and a Flask web application.

## Project Overview

The project can be divided into the following key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**:
   - In the initial phase, we thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality.
   - We performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and create relevant features for the prediction task.

2. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - We built a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on the processed data.
   - The model achieved an R2 score of 0.92 on the test data, demonstrating its predictive capabilities.

3. **Flask Web Application**:
   - To make the model accessible and user-friendly, we developed a web application using Flask.
   - Users can input car details, and the application will provide price predictions based on the model's calculations.
